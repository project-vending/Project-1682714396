#  Cloud-based Data WarehouseCreate a data warehouse using AWS Redshift to store data reliably and securely, making it accessible for analysis and reporting. Use AWS Glue and Apache Airflow to extract, transform and load data into the Redshift data warehouse, and Streamlit for monitoring the data warehouse's health status with appropriate real-time logging and visualization. Finally, use Great Expectations to validate the data and ensure that the data warehouse isnâ€™t corrupt.
